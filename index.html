    <h2>Why you should <span class="highLights">hire</span> me</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of experience with using the best practices to accomplish task, identifying creative solutions to atypical problems and managing risk for a medium-sized team. Most of my responsibilities in the U.S. Army required troubleshooting problems
      as quickly and efficiently as possible. These skills along with my other work experiences should translate well to the tasks identified in the career posting and my personality should lead to a fast training time.</p>

    <p><span class='highLights'>“The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.</span><br>
      ― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Throne<br>
      <span class='highLights'>“Winter is coming.”</span><br>
      ― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones<br>
      <span class='highLights'>“Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”</span><br>
